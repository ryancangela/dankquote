              <p class="modal-date"><span style="font-weight: 800;">When: </span>Playboy, October 2004</p>
              <div class="article">
                <p>It was surprisingly hard for Trump to let go. He had spent days—weeks—blithely, practically defiantly
                  modeling precisely what not to do during this burgeoning, life-altering crisis of a pandemic. He
                  mingled with dignitaries at dinner. He convened news conferences with officials packed tighter than
                  class pictures. And he shook hands like he’d never heard a single warning about how the coronavirus
                  spreads. Then came Monday. Along with his noted change in tone at an appropriately sober briefing at
                  the White House, the president finally seemed to heed the bare-minimum counsel of public health
                  professionals—and refrained from pressing any flesh. What was remarkable about Trump’s obstinacy to
                  that point wasn’t that he was flouting elite experts’ advice—more or less par for the course—but
                  rather that he wasn’t jumping at this opportunity to revert to one of his strongest and
                  longest-standing prepolitics precepts. For most of his life, he didn’t just shun shaking hands. He
                  detested shaking hands. And he made this bugaboo of his nothing if not characteristically explicit. A
                  self-described “germaphobe,” “germ freak” and “clean-hands freak,” Trump over the years has called the
                  practice of the handshake “barbaric,” “disgusting,” “very, very terrible” and “one of the curses of
                  American society.” He so stubbornly kept shaking hands, though, in the estimation of people who know
                  him well, even as the spread of the virus started to spike, in an instinctual effort to avoid any
                  implicit admission that he whiffed on preparedness or miscalculated the virus’ severity and to project
                  as well his preferred patina of sanguine vigor and insusceptibility. Symbolism superseded safety. “He
                  went from being a germaphobe to being a germaholic,” former Trump Organization executive vice
                  president Louise Sunshine told me. “It’s a subconscious, if not conscious, way of saying, ‘Relax!
                  Everything’s OK!’ Because if everything is not OK, he was wrong, and he can never be wrong,” added
                  Alan Marcus, a former Trump publicist. “It’s more important for him to be right than to do right.”
                  “What I’ve been thinking on this issue of one of the more famous germaphobes in the world sort of
                  deliberately shaking hands recently,” Trump biographer Gwenda Blair said, “is that it seemed to have
                  been some kind of show of strength—excuse me, of presumed strength—and invulnerability, a way to
                  telegraph that he is not cowed, not scared, not going to be intimidated.” In the Rose Garden last
                  Friday, for instance, when he declared a national emergency, “two very big words,” as he put it, Trump
                  also nonetheless shook a bunch of hands. He shook hands with the CEO of Walmart. He shook hands with
                  the CEO of Target. He shook hands with the CEO of Quest Diagnostics.</p>
                <p>He shook hands with the president of Walgreens. He shook hands with a vice president of CVS. And he
                  tried to shake hands with an executive from the health care company called LHC Group. Bruce
                  Greenstein, however, left him hanging, instead offering a best-practices elbow bump. Trump responded
                  with a slight grimace, a sucking in of air, and an awkward attempt to touch elbows. “Practice that,”
                  Greenstein said. “OK. I like that. That’s good,” Trump said—unconvincingly. But by Monday, there he
                  was, in the White House, not shaking any hands, and not bumping any elbows, either, cringeworthy or
                  otherwise. People keyed in on his dire words. “It’s bad. It’s bad.” But the absence of the simple
                  gestures said just as much. All of the conspicuous handshaking, and in the face of a deadly disease no
                  less, really was quite something to behold for everybody who’s known Trump for a long time, or who has
                  been watching Trump for a long time, or who simply has done the requisite reading. “I’ve always had
                  very strong feelings about cleanliness. I’m constantly washing my hands, and it wouldn’t bother me if
                  I never had to shake hands with a well-meaning stranger again,” he said in Surviving at the Top, his
                  book that was published in 1990, likening himself to the eccentric Howard Hughes on account of their
                  shared “aversion to germs.” “You have germaphobia,” the shock jock Howard Stern said to him on his
                  show in 1993. “True?” “I do,” Trump said. He was “preoccupied by a fear of communicable disease,”
                  according to Jack O’Donnell, a former Trump casino executive in Atlantic City. As much as Trump needed
                  the energy of the crowds, he loathed the actual reality of close-one-proximity intermingling, gamblers
                  clamoring to shake his hand or merely to touch him for luck. Once ensconced again in an office, he was
                  sure to hustle to a bathroom to lather his hands with soap. “The first thing he did,” O’Donnell once
                  told me. “I feel much better after I thoroughly wash my hands,” he said in The Art of the Comeback in
                  1997. In 1999, when Trump toyed with the idea of running for president, his anti-handshake posture
                  briefly became a topic of conversation among the talking heads on TV. “How are you going to run for
                  office and not press the flesh?” Stone Phillips asked him on NBC. “Look,” Trump said, “if I have to do
                  it, I do it.” “If you’re a politician at the rope line,” Wolf Blitzer pointed out on CNN, “you’ve got
                  no choice.” Trump mostly conceded. “I guess if you’re a politician …” It didn’t mean he liked it.
                  Before he incorporated into his speeches and rallies as president a stock bit about “tough,” “burly”
                  men crying when they see him or the Oval Office while calling him “sir,” Trump talked regularly about
                  men not just wanting to shake his hand but specifically emerging from bathrooms in restaurants to do
                  it. “Almost nothing bothers me more than sitting down for dinner at a beautiful restaurant and having
                  a man you’ve just seen leaving the men’s room, perhaps not even having washed his hands, spot you and
                  run over to your table with a warm and friendly face, hand outstretched,” he said in Comeback. “The
                  other night I was having dinner at a beautiful restaurant, and I see a guy coming out of a men’s
                  room,” he explained to Geraldo Rivera on CNBC in 1999. “And he said, ‘Mr. Trump, I’m a huge fan of
                  yours.’ And he puts out his hand. And, literally, I’m eating a roll …” “The good news is,” he said on
                  CNN to Blitzer, unspooling the same tale two days later, “you don’t eat that roll.” “I was a little
                  overweight at the time,” he said in 2004 in his book called How to Get Rich, “and knew that if I shook
                  his hand I wouldn’t eat my meal—and that would be a good thing.” The main takeaway, as ever, as he put
                  it in a header of a chapter: “Avoid the Handshake Whenever Possible.” Trump at times marveled at the
                  people who don’t see this the way he does.</p>
                <p>Like Bill Clinton. “Clinton was shaking hands with 500 or 600 people,” he told Rivera toward the end
                  of Clinton’s second term. “He then got into the back of the presidential limo, grabs a sandwich and he
                  eats it, and no problem. I wish I could be like that. I just can’t.” And he seldom missed an
                  opportunity to say he wasn’t wrong. “Statistically, I’ve been proven right. Many studies have found
                  that you catch colds and who knows what else from shaking hands,” he told Playboy in 2004. “It’s a
                  medical fact,” he said in Rich. “A lot of people are agreeing with me,” he once told Blitzer. MOST

                  during the Ebola outbreak centered in West Africa, Trump took to Twitter: “Something very important,
                  and indeed society changing, may come out of the Ebola epidemic that will be a very good thing: NO
                  SHAKING HANDS!” Eight and a half months later, of course, he came down that escalator to announce he
                  was launching a run for the White House. He was (however reluctantly) ready to shake some hands. His
                  was the Purell presidency well before this pandemic. Lots and lots of handwashing near the Oval. Wipes
                  served with his steak and two scoops. His body man’s unsparing squirts of hand sanitizer. But he has
                  done, too, what he said he would do, all the way back in 1999. Politicians have to shake hands. And
                  from Vladimir Putin to Kim Jong Un, from Emmanuel Macron to Justin Trudeau, Trump as the handshaking
                  president has made news, made history, made … people uncomfortable. And through the past few months
                  and weeks, as the coronavirus continued to get worse and Trump continued to insist that it wasn’t, he
                  kept shaking hands. With supporters at Mar-a-Lago. With tornado victims in Tennessee. With audience
                  members in Scranton at a Fox News town hall. “I’ll be shaking hands with people—and they want to say
                  hello and hug you and kiss you—I don’t care,” he said March 5. “You are shaking a lot of hands today
                  and taking close-one pictures,” a reporter said to Trump on March 6. “Are you protecting yourself at
                  all?” “No,” he answered. “Not at all.” “Why are you shaking hands, sir?” he was asked just this past
                  Saturday. “Because it almost becomes a habit,” Trump said. He offered, maybe to himself, that he used
                  to be “a non-handshaker, for the most part.” Eventually, though, he granted that people are “thinking
                  about it more and more.” Even Trump. Again. Blair, the Trump biographer, told me she heard during
                  Monday’s news conference an echo of the language of the germaphobe of old. “It washes through,” the
                  president said of the eventual end of the outbreak. He acknowledged that “other people don’t like that
                  term,” but Trump went ahead, anyway, and repeated it. “It washes through.”</p>

                  better than me, believe me, and I’ll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall
                  on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall,” Trump said in his June 16, 2015
                  speech at Trump Tower. “Mark my words.” Like many of the claims in that speech, Trump did not offer
                  specifics. But as the campaign went on, he said he would find the money by reducing the trade deficit
                  (that wouldn’t really work), convincing Mexico to pay with clever deal-making, forcing it to pay by
                  blocking wire transfers and visas, increasing visa fees on Mexican citizens or building the wall first
                  and convincing Mexico to reimburse the U.S.</p>
                <p>In 2016, Trump even said specifically that Mexico would be compelled to give the U.S. a “one-time
                  payment” of $5 to 10 billion for the wall, both in a memo sent to reporters and in his campaign
                  platform. But as he prepared to fly to the southern border on Thursday, Trump changed his tune,
                  claiming, falsely, that he never said that Mexico would pay for the border wall and that he never
                  meant that the country would literally hand the U.S. money for the wall.</p>
                <p>“When during the campaign, I would say ‘Mexico is going to pay for it,’ obviously, I never said this,
                  and I never meant they’re gonna write out a check, I said they’re going to pay for it. They are,”
                  Trump said Again, Trump did say Mexico would pay for the wall, and he did say that it would hand the
                  U.S. money for it. Trump’s latest comment about Mexico paying for the wall came just hours after White
                  House strategic communications director Mercedes Schlapp said in a CNN interview that U.S. taxpayers
                  will foot the bill for the wall. “Yes. And you know what else taxpayers are paying for? The financial
                  burden of this illegal immigration,” Schlapp said Wednesday in response to a question about whether
                  Americans were paying for the wall.</p>
                <p>Trump’s statement also comes amid a partial government shutdown designed to coerce House Democrats
                  into voting for $5.7 billion for a wall or “steel barrier” on the southern border. As president, Trump
                  has argued that Mexico will pay for the wall indirectly through the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement,
                  which has not been ratified. However, experts say that the new deal doesn’t have any provisions to use
                  tariff funds to build a wall and that Mexico would never agree to the treaty if it did. “That’s not
                  the way trade agreements work,” Welles Orr, who worked on the original NAFTA agreement as the
                  Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Congressional Affairs under George H.W. Bush, told TIME.
                  “Tariffs that are collected by the U.S. Treasury would fund the U.S. Treasury.” The claim that Mexico
                  would pay for the wall indirectly is at odds with the Trump campaign’s most specific descriptions of
                  how it would work. In a two-page memo released to the Washington Post and other outlets on March 31,
                  2016, Trump presented a detailed plan on how to “compel Mexico to pay for the wall.” This plan would
                  include including implementing new trade tariffs, cancelling visas and increasing visa fees. The memo
                  said the first step would be to block Mexican nationals who are in the U.S., legally and illegally,
                  from wiring money back to Mexico. Trump wrote that this would prevent about $24 billion from flowing
                  into Mexico.</p>
                <p>“It’s an easy decision for Mexico. Make a one-time payment of $5 – $10 billion to ensure that $24
                  billion continues to flow into their country year after year,” the memo said.Trump’s campaign platform
                  also said that the U.S. would take multiple steps to force Mexico to pay for the wall. Besides
                  impounding remittances, the platform said that as president, he would would also increase fees for
                  visas and border crossing cards, as well as fees at border entries.“We will not be taken advantage of
                  anymore,” the platform concluded. Trump had also previously suggested other ways that Mexico could pay
                  for the wall. In an April 2015 tweet, Trump wrote that the U.S. deduct the cost of the wall “from
                  Mexican foreign aid.”</p>

              <p class="modal-date"><span style="font-weight: 800;">When: </span>SNBC, March 2016</p>
              <div class="article">
                <p>Women who have abortions should be punished if the practice were illegal, Republican presidential
                  frontrunner Donald Trump said on Wednesday, before retracting his claim amid an outcry. Trump, who has
                  held opposing positions on the abortion in the past, said women should receive “some form of
                  punishment” if it were banned in the US. He was unable to say whether he believed the punishment
                  should be a small fine or a long prison sentence.</p>
                <p>The remarks prompted an outcry from all quarters, and once again underscored his poor approval
                  ratings among women. The Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, decribed the comments as “horrific
                  and telling”. Anti-abortion campaigners, who focus their efforts on punishing those who carry out
                  abortions, distanced themselves from the remarks. Amid the storm, Trump issued a swift clarification
                  of the comments. His position “had not changed”, he said, despite going on to fully recant the earlier
                  statements he made to interviewer Chris Matthews on MSNBC. The latest Trump conflagration began during
                  the taping of a town hall event, when Matthews asked him to define his “pro-life” stance and
                  assertions that abortion should be banned.</p>
                <ul>
                  <p>
                    “Do you believe in punishment for abortion – yes or no – as a principle,” asked Matthews.<br>
                    “The answer is there has to be some form of punishment,” said Trump.<br>
                    “For the woman?” Matthews said.<br>
                    “Yeah, there has to be some form,” Trump replied.<br>
                    “Ten cents, 10 years, what,” Matthews asked again, pressing.<br>
                    “That I don’t know,” said Trump.<br>
                  </p>
                </ul>
                <p>Trump’s hazy stance on abortion ‘punishment’ The 90-second exchange inflamed Democratic pro-choice
                  advocates, Republicans who have criticized Trump for flip-flopping on the issue, and anti-abortion
                  advocates.In a 1999 interview, Trump described himself as “pro-choice in every respect”, and also said
                  he would not “ban abortion” if he was ever elected president. But his position as a presidential
                  candidate has changed starkly. Trump later tried to clarify his position in a statement. Donald Trump

                  anti-abortion law would fall to Congress or state legislatures.</p>
                <p>“If Congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this
                  legislation, or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law, the doctor or
                  any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the
                  woman. The woman is a victim in this case as is the life in her womb. My position has not changed –
                  like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with exceptions,” the statement said.</p>

                February 2016</p>
              <div class="article">
                <p>Donald Trump opened the door to torturing terrorism suspects if he's elected president, telling ABC
                  News Sunday that waterboarding "doesn't sound very severe" given the barbarism of ISIS. Here's what
                  Trump said in a telephone interview with ABC's Jonathan Karl.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <p>
                    “JON KARL: Would President Trump authorize waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation
                    techniques, even torture?"<br>
                    “DONALD TRUMP: I would be inclined to be very strong. When people are chopping off other people's
                    heads and then we're worried about waterboarding and we can't because ... I have no doubt that that
                    works. I have absolutely no doubt."<br>
                    “JON KARL: So you'd bring back water-boarding?"<br>
                    “DONALD TRUMP: You mentioned waterboarding, which was such a big subject. I haven't heard that term
                    in a year now, because when you see the other side chopping off heads, waterboarding doesn't sound
                    very severe."<br>
                  </p>
                </ul>
                <p>In his first week in office in 2009, President Barack Obama banned the CIA's use of waterboarding and
                  other brutal treatment of detainees, vowing that the United States "will not torture."
                  A Senate Intelligence Committee report released in December 2014 revealed gory details of the CIA's
                  treatment of detainees, including the insertion of hummus into one prisoner's rectum. The committee
                  concluded that none of it worked.
                  "The committee finds, based on a review of CIA interrogation records, that the use of the CIA's
                  enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of obtaining accurate information or
                  gaining detainee cooperation," the panel wrote.
                </p>
                <p>Trump is the leader in GOP presidential primary polls, including a Wall Street Journal/NBC News
                  survey released Sunday that shows him with 19 percent backing, compared with 15 percent for Wisconsin
                  Gov. Scott Walker and 14 percent for former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.
                  The aggressive stance on torture probably won't hurt Trump in the Republican primary — and it may help
                  him. In December 2014, 73 percent of Republicans told CBS News pollsters that enhanced interrogation
                  techniques are sometimes justified.

              <p class="modal-date"><span style="font-weight: 800;">When: </span>Playboy, October 2004</p>
              <div class="article">
                <p>Somehow it’s fitting that the Friars Club, the venerable brotherhood of shtick men, has chosen to
                  roast Donald Trump at its centennial celebration this month. Few billionaires have provided as many
                  punch lines as the flamboyant real estate developer with the bombproof comb-over and inexcusable
                  tastes. Even with the gold-plated success of The Apprentice, “the hottest reality show in the history
                  of TV,” as Trump likes to call it, it’s hard not to laugh at the high-camp spectacle that is the
                  Donald’s life.
                  But if the current Trump renaissance has taught us anything, it’s that the joke is on the rest of us.
                  Even if you can’t stand his pink ties or squinty I’m-so-great delivery, you have to admire Trump for
                  staying on top as long as he has. He nearly went bankrupt during the early-1990s real estate slump,
                  only to fight back with more cash than ever. He sucked it up through tacky marriages and public
                  divorces, only to find romance with Slovenian model Melania Knauss, his fiancée. And in New York City,
                  where Trump bashing had become as common as turbaned cabbies, he now outhits even the Yankees on the
                  hometown popularity scale.
                <p>It’s hard to say whether The Apprentice made him cool again or whether Trump finally brought cool to
                  the hot-tubbing, spitswapping squalor of “unscripted” television. More than 20 million people watched
                  the original series each week, with twice that many tuning in for at least part of the finale, when
                  Trump hired cigar salesman Bill Rancic to help construct a 90-story Chicago tower. By the end, The
                  Apprentice had become more than just a TV show. It was required viewing at such places as Harvard
                  Business School and the Wharton school of business, and more than a million people applied to take
                  part in round two, which airs this fall.
                  Not that being a Hollywood titan satisfies Trump, who just keeps moving and building, stamping his
                  name in gold wherever he goes. His latest book, How to Get Rich, is his fifth national best-seller,
                  and his latest real estate deals are bringing that special brand of Trump splendor to the Caribbean,
                  Brazil and even Korea.</p>
                <p>Born in Queens in 1946, Trump grew up learning to master the universe from his father, Fred, who
                  accumulated millions by selling moderately priced housing to half of Brooklyn and Queens. Not long
                  after Trump the younger crossed the bridge into Manhattan, his behind-the-scenes exploits rivaled the
                  spectacle of his gleaming skyscrapers. His marriages to Ivana and Marla Maples fed a generation of
                  gossip columnists. And even with his current popularity, tabloids love to find chinks in his armor:
                  The casinos are failing! The stockholders are angry! The billions don’t exist!</p>
                <p>Trump met with journalist David Hochman over the course of a few days at Trump Tower in Manhattan,
                  midway through the second Apprentice shoot. Hochman reports: “Carving big chunks of time out of his
                  busy schedule isn’t easy. During one two-hour interview, his executive assistant, Rhona Graff-Riccio,
                  logged more than 50 phone messages. The only call Trump took was from his son Eric, one of his four
                  children. Trump says he always takes his kids’ calls. Despite a harried production schedule and a
                  docket full of meetings, public events and charity functions—as well as various interruptions from
                  Trump Organization honchos such as Carolyn Kepcher and other unwitting stars of The Apprentice—Trump
                  was focused, enthusiastic, open and direct. He was even gracious enough to leave me with a lapel pin
                  featuring the catchphrase of the year: ‘You’re fired!’”</p>

                  It was January 2004 and Donald Trump was on the “Today Show” to promote a new reality TV series called
                  “The Apprentice.”
                  Almost immediately after the interview began, Trump started bragging about the unparalleled intellect
                  of the contestants who would compete for a job at one of his companies.
                  “These are 16 brilliant people. I mean, they have close to 200 IQs, all of them,” he told host Matt
                  Lauer. “And some may be beautiful and some may not be beautiful. But everybody has an incredible
                  brain.”
                  It wasn’t the first time Trump fixated on IQ as a measure of a person’s worth — or, as is frequently
                  the case, worthlessness. And it wouldn’t be the last. Fifteen years later, Trump, now president of the
                  United States, still uses IQ as a shorthand for intelligence, dividing the people in his orbit into
                  winners and losers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In private, according to interviews with a half-dozen people close to him, Trump frequently asserts
                  that people he likes have genius-level IQs. At various points during his presidency, he’s told aides
                  that Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson and Apple CEO Tim Cook are high-IQ individuals, for example,
                  former White House officials said. Trump has also dubbed himself a “very stable genius” on multiple
                  occasions. And the president is quick to accuse his political enemies of having low IQs, as he did
                  when he repeated North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s criticism of former Vice President Joe Biden, one
                  of his leading Democratic challengers.
                  “I was actually sticking up for Sleepy Joe Biden while on foreign soil. Kim Jong Un called him a ‘low
                  IQ idiot,’ and many other things, whereas I related the quote of Chairman Kim as a much softer ‘low IQ
                  individual,’” Trump said Tuesday after the Biden campaign criticized him for tweeting during his trip
                  to Japan that he smiled when Kim insulted Biden’s intelligence.
                  While the exact reason for Trump’s IQ obsession is difficult to nail down, people who know him suspect
                  it stems in part from his desire to project an image of success and competence, despite scattered
                  business failings and repeated allegations from critics that he’s incompetent. Trump is also known for
                  being thin-skinned. He often fires back at anyone who criticizes him with a barrage of insults, while
                  simultaneously building himself up.
                </p>
                <p>“I don’t think you have to put him on the couch to see that someone who has such a consistent need to
                  build himself up and belittle everyone else must have some problems with self-esteem,” said Trump
                  biographer Gwenda Blair, who wrote a book about the Trump family. “It’s a lifelong theme for him.”
                  “Part of it comes from his insecurities about not being perceived as intelligent,” a former White
                  House official added.
                  In recent years, Trump has accused Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), actor Robert De Niro, Washington
                  Post staffers, former President George W. Bush, comedian Jon Stewart, Republican strategist Rick
                  Wilson, MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski, and Rick Perry, now his Energy secretary, of having low IQs. He
                  once suggested he’d like to compare his IQ to that of then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, adding,
                  “And I can tell you who is going to win.” He privately mocked former Attorney General Jeff Sessions’
                  intelligence, according to a former White House official. All the while, Trump has claimed his Cabinet
                  has the highest IQ of any assembled in history.
                  “Sorry losers and haters, but my I.Q. is one of the highest -and you all know it! Please don't feel so
                  stupid or insecure, it's not your fault,” Trump tweeted in 2013.
                  Just last week, the president again referred to himself as an “extremely stable genius,” and he has
                  spent years insisting he has a high IQ score, though he has never revealed the exact number. When a
                  Twitter critic challenged him in 2013 to prove his high IQ, Trump responded simply, “The highest,
                  asshole!”

              <div class="article">
                <p>Donald Trump teases an upcoming presidential campaign in an interview for Time magazine, which states
                  that he’s discussing making an announcement in late May. His ideas outlined in Time include placing a
                  25% tariff on all Chinese imports, forcing South Korea to “pay us for protection” from North Korea,
                  and threatening to remove military aid for OPEC members unless they made oil cheaper. He promotes
                  himself as anti-gay and pro-life, and, of course, says that he can make America great again.
                  He also says he’s excited to show his taxes, which he has yet to do 10 years later at the time of this
                  writing. While the Time piece might be the first acknowledgement that Trump is planning to run for the
                  presidency, his campaigning really began when he became the mascot of the Obama birther conspiracy.
                  Donald Trump, 64, a golden mist of hair wafting perfectly across his forehead, holds up fresh evidence
                  of his greatness. “This thing just came out,” Trump says, waving a 2012 Republican primary poll from
                  the website Newsmax. “This is Trump.”
                <p>He points to a bar graph showing the 57% of voters who support his unannounced campaign for
                  President. Then he points below…. The poll doesn’t really mean much, having been culled from a
                  self-selected group of Internet surfers who clicked banner ads displaying Trump’s face….
                  “Nobody can do the job that I can do… I can make this country great again. This country is not great.
                  This country is a laughingstock for the rest of the world.” He has been repeating that sound bite for
                  weeks, as if the nation were just another run-down co-op in need of redevelopment. But his play is not
                  new….
                </p>
                <p>“NBC wants to renew me for three seasons,” Trump explains. “I’ve told them, I’m sorry. At this
                  moment, I can’t think about that because I have a big decision to make.” He has been chatting up the
                  new head of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, and speaking regularly to Christopher
                  Ruddy, the proprietor of Newsmax and a force in conservative circles, who happens to be a member of
                  Trump’s opulent Palm Beach, Fla., club Mar-a-Lago. Trump has also been reconnoitering with Kellyanne
                  Conway, a Republican pollster who lives in a Trump building in Manhattan. There are plans in the works
                  for a sit-down with pro-life leaders. “He can win,” claims Conway, bucking the nearly unanimous view
                  among the Beltway elite, explaining that “2012 is an aspiration election. When you think aspiration
                  and upward mobility, you think Donald Trump.” ….</p>
                <p>“He’s a working-class hero,” argues [Roger] Stone, who is no longer employed by Trump but is
                  soliciting contributions for the cause at DraftTrump2012.com. “Blacks and Hispanics and lower-class
                  whites like his lifestyle.”</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, one of Trump’s senior executives, Michael Cohen, has been leading another Trump 2012
                  charge, booking interviews and appearances for Trump and financing a website called
                  ShouldTrumpRun.com. Cohen works closely with Stewart Rahr, a billionaire philanthropist known in the
                  society pages as Stewie Rah Rah, the No. 1 King of All Fun, who once handed out a business card that
                  looked like a $1 billion bill, emblazoned with a picture of Rahr, Trump and former President Bill
                  Clinton on a golf outing. “I believe the country needs leadership,” says Rahr, who also lives in a
                  Trump building, belongs to Trump’s country clubs and has promised to spend whatever he legally can to
                  elect him…</p>

              <div class="article">
                <p>Cast your mind back to when all you knew about Donald Trump was that he was a turbo-tanned, wealthy
                  businessman who did the bit Alan Sugar does on the US version of The Apprentice. Oh, life was so much
                  simpler then.
                  When it comes to women, much of what has tripped out of Trump's mouth hasn't exactly been great. But
                  now, despite his derogatory views on women and minorities, Trump is hoping to secure his second term
                  as the 45th President of the United states of America. So, just in case you weren't feeling concerned
                  enough about the potential outcome of Tuesday's US presidential election, here are 25 real things
                  Trump has actually said about women.</p>
                <p>1. "I'm automatically attracted to beautiful women — I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet.
                  Just kiss. I don't even wait. When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab 'em by
                  the pussy. You can do anything." (Secret video recording, 2005)</p>
                <p>2. "Look at that face. Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next next
                  president? I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not supposed to say bad things, but really, folks, come on.
                  Are we serious?" (About Carly Fiorina, his one-time Republican rival, 2015)</p>
                <p>3. "We’re getting your husbands back to work. Everybody wants it." (Aimed at women attending a
                  campaign rally in Michigan, 2020)</p>
                <p>4. "I like kids. I mean, I won’t do anything to take care of them. I’ll supply funds and she’ll take
                  care of the kids. It’s not like I’m gonna be walking the kids down Central Park." (An interview with
                  Howard Stern, 2005)</p>
                <p>5. "[Arianna Huffington] is unattractive both inside and out. I fully understand why her former
                  husband left her for a man - he made a good decision." (Twitter, 2012)</p>

              <div class="article">
                <p>When Donald Trump was watching his 16-year-old daughter Ivanka host the 1997 Miss Teen USA pageant,
                  he turned to the then-Miss Universe and asked: “Don’t you think my daughter’s hot? She’s hot, right?”
                </p>
                <p>That anecdote, told to the New York Times by Brook Antoinette Mahealani Lee, appears to be the first
                  recorded incident of the Republican presidential candidate and reality TV star making comments about
                  his daughter’s body which those present have deemed inappropriate.</p>
                <p>In the almost 20 years since, Mr Trump has called his eldest daughter “voluptuous”. He’s said it’s OK
                  to describe her as “a piece of ass”, though she is a senior executive in his business empire. And he’s
                  said that, if she wasn’t his daughter, “perhaps [he’d] be dating her”.</p>
                <p>Mr Trump’s history of denigrating women has come to fore of the US presidential debate, after audio
                  tapes emerged of him boasting about “grabbing them by the p***y” from a 2005 recording of Access
                  Hollywood.</p>
                <p>Here’s a recap of all the way he has spoken about one of the most important women in his life, Ivanka
                  Trump.</p>
                <p><strong>On The Howard Stern Show, 2003:</strong><br>Trump bragged about his then-22-year-old
                  daughter’s body, saying: “You know who’s one of the great beauties of the world, according to
                  everybody? And I helped create her. Ivanka.
                  “My daughter, Ivanka. She’s 6 feet tall, she’s got the best body. She made a lot money as a model—a
                  tremendous amount.”</p>
                <p><strong>New York magazine interview, December 2004:</strong><br>“Let me tell you one thing: Ivanka is
                  a great, great beauty. Every guy in the country wants to go out with my daughter. But she’s got a
                  boyfriend.”</p>
